This project was about training an intelligent agent to navigate a maze. I was given most of the code surrounding this task including the code for the maze game, creating the model, and the tests to see if the agent succeeds. My main contribution is in configuring how the agent will learn and training the model. I had to determine what I thought the best way for it to handle learning using deep Q-learning would be.

I did this by doing what you often do in computer science: taking in the facts about the technology Iâ€™m using and figuring out the best way to use it. I saw that I needed to do deep Q-learning so I broke the problem down into steps that I could then turn into code. Figuring out how to break a complex problem into many small problems is the crux of being a computer scientist since at the end of the day, a computer is doing the same thing, just far faster.

Working with AI related topics however means I must be extra careful when it comes down to my ethical considerations. All computer scientists must think of this however AI involves more black boxes than most other forms of programming. Since this is a bunch of black boxes mixed with automation, great care must be taken in making sure the process and result are ethical since a lot of operations will happen without direct human involvement or oversight.
